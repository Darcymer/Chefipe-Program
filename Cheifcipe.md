# Overview

Software engineers have many ways to be able to adapt and respond to the consumers, and create things that are able to make our lives better. One of the many tools that software engineer should utilize is how to utilize databases, which is very important in many businesses and many operations around the world. This project was to be dedicated to allow me to learn about databases, in particularly SQL relational databases, which is one of the more useful database tools in coding.

The purpose of me for writing this type of code is to have me understand and learn how to utilize SQL databases more, as well as implementing such databases into other coding languages that I have used, in this case being python.

The program that I have created is a recipe book, which allows the user to implement modify delete ingredients, recipes, and the style of recipe that the user wishes.

# Relational Database

The relation of database that I am using is SQL, particularly the SQLite program that is provided through python. The structure of the database is as follows, each user begins with a table, each table then refers to a style which each style refers to a recipe and each recipe has their own set of ingredients.

# Development Environment

Python And SQL

The IDE is Visual Studio Code

# Future Work

* 1. Implement a way for users to implement their input and allow for the database to delete said inputs.
* 2. Fix a bug where the databases are not printing out the results from the user input.
* 3. Implement a way for the user to create a table
* 4. Implement primary keys to the tables
